## Architecture Design

As suggested in the classes, the design model used will be the well known MVC (model-view-controller) and each one of these components will be a different package to work with the main game class (SpaceCruiser here).
Each of them will be made by a game class (GameController, GameView, GameModel) and a package representing different entities.
This division of tasks in different packages allows for better debugging and unit testing, as well as organizing the code making it simpler to understand.
