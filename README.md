## Architecture Design

    Package and class diagram (UML), documenting (describing) each class' responsibility. If you are using external libraries, APIs or frameworks (e.g. libGDX, Android SDK, ...), try to keep mentioning their classes to a minimum (on the diagrams), only to allow understanding on how your system is going to work. You may use Papyrus or Enterprise Architect to produce the UML diagrams. 
    Design of behavioural aspects (that you might consider relevant) of your application, depicted using dynamic UML diagrams (sequence, activity or state).
    Expected (if any) Design Patterns to use on your application. It should be clearly defined how and why the pattern is going to be used, its participating classes, their roles and responsibilities. Besides identifying DPs already implemented on the external library, API or framework you are using, extra credit will be given, if the design pattern is fully developed within your own code, without relying on the external source (it should not be redundant with the DPs already provided by the external source).
